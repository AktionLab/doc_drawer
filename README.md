Doc Drawer
=========

This repo contains documentation for various topics. Each topic is broken up into a high level section, then broken down into topics. The sections are explained here, the topics explained in a README within the sections directory. Each section contains its own README file that gives a brief description of each topic.

Most categories will have a few common topics, these include:
* Getting Started - Explaining how to get setup to work with whatever the category is describing.
* Cheatsheet - A short list of common actions or commands that will be used frequently.
* Links - Links to project pages, tutorials, blog posts, books and other related topics.

In most cases this will be it, as most topics are well explained in tutorials or books that are readily available on the web. In cases where there is some internal way of doing things that is not explained in external literature, a topic will exist to explain the processes.
